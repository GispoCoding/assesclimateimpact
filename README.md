# Climate Tool

Climate Tool is a QGIS plugin for assessing climate impacts in cities. The plugin is under development and will be released here in June 2019. The plugin will need a PostGIS connection in order to work. The datasets needed will be listed here. The tool is provided by the joint cooperation of City of Tampere, Ubigu Ltd, TietoTakomo & Gispo Ltd. Many thanks to the project team!

We are tryint to model the climate impacts in the cities with this tool that provides the information about the current situation for energyefficiency and also provides scenarios for the future. In the inital face only datasets from the City of Tampere are used. It takes into account several information from the cities:

- Building
- Traffic
- Elecricity consumption
